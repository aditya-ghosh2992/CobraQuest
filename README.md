## Overview

This Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the game borders or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
2. Navigate the snake to eat the red food squares to grow longer.
3. Avoid collisions with the game borders and the snake's body.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with the borders or itself.
